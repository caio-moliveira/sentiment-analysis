Thank you for taking the time to review our hotel. I am delighted that you found the hotel to be clean and comfortable and that our onsite carparking was to our liking.  To put your mind at ease, it was our Accommodation Supervisor that knocked on the door. There was nothing sinister in it, after the rooms are cleaned the Supervisor checks to ensure that the room is neatly presented for the guest when they return to their room, this would be standard procedure. The Supervisor knocked and when she didn't hear a response she used her key, retreating when you told her that you were in the room. I will ensure that in future our team are more vocal in explaining the reason they are there rather than leave themselves open to such allegations that can be quite upsetting. Thank you for your feedback on the matter, it will help us to improve our training going forward.

Last orders at 10 30, due to covid bar closes at 11and you must go to your bedroom at this time.  I understand covid has placed restrictions but I think it should be made very clear prior to booking about these restrictions as I didn't know prior to booking.

Thank you for taking the time to review the hotel. I am delighted that overall you enjoyed your stay with us, and I am pleased to hear you found our hotel clean and to be in a great location.  
There is a charge for car parking at the hotel which is notified to guests at the booking stage. Guests that reserve their room directly with the hotel are offered complimentary car parking. I am sorry to hear that the bar service wasn't great. I have raised this issue with the Bar Manager, who is looking into this, with the additional sanitizing and table service only it can be difficult but the bar is adequately staffed and there is no excuse for you having to get up and look for attention. As you mentioned due to covid we do have measures in place which mean that our bar and lobby area are clear by 11.30pm, this is the law for all hotels in Ireland.

Thank you for taking the time to review the hotel. I am pleased to hear you liked our rooms and our excellent location.

Every effort is made to ensure that only residents park in our car park on match days, as with all car parks there are a certain amount of spaces and when there are full there is no possibility of more being provided. The vans you saw belonged to guests of the hotel. 
I am extremely saddened to read you didn't get a good sleep, it is extremely unusual for our hotel to have issues with noise coming from the car park. Please contact us if you are staying with us in the future, and we will ensure that you are happy with your visit.

If your attending Shelbourne greyhound track or the Aviva for a match the hotel is great location","The breakfast, well more the cost I had to pay and the attitude of the person who decided the cost for breakfast.
I got hash brown,beans and mushroom, small glass of juice.
All the portions were small
NO TEA/COFFEE
NO TOAST 
Firstly she wanted to charge for full Irish breakfast as that’s all they do she said ? 
I explained I’m a vegetarian hence no meat stuff

Thank you for your review. I am sorry that you were not satisfied with the response of the two members of our team that responded to your calls. The room next door had a tv/radio on but it was not at a level that the staff members could hear it. The guest kindly turned it off when asked, I am sorry that this did not resolve your issue. New Year's Eve is usually a night where hotels are quite noisy, thankfully yours was the only report of any such complaint on the night.

Unfortunately, due to the age of some of our baths the enamel, whilst cleaned does not look white. It is something that we are working towards fixing during our next refurbishment. In the meantime, if you are visiting, please contact us directly and we can arrange for you to have one of our newly refurbished bathrooms with shower.
Kind regards,

Thank you for your wonderful review, your opinion means a lot to us. We always strive to deliver high standards and to ensure that all our guests leave with beautiful memories. We are sorry to hear you found the room cold – we have scheduled heating times during the day so our guests will be comfortable, but we also provide portable heaters in case the temperature is not high enough. With regards to the toiletries, it is unfortunate that you were unhappy with them and did not feel that you could call our reception team to have them replenished or replaced.
We hope to see you soon again!

There were few other options in the immediate area on a Saturday AM so the quality and selections  was greatly appreciated.  Exceeded expectations.

Also the coffee shop and lobby are nice to relax or get a refreshment even if you're not staying there.  The restaurant next door is a convenient option for a quick bite. They also have continuous room service in the hotel. We stayed on the 2nd floor and noise was reasonable other than a few doors or late talkers in the hall.  

Location was pretty enjoyable and relaxing","Got back to the hotel at 7pm on Friday and there was no parking available, but they had already charged me €10 for the night.  So the next day they were able to give me a partial refund during checkout.  I should've argued this when I got back there to be honest but was tired and didn't think straight, yet mentioned my concern in the morning.  The hotel garage is small, so be aware if you're bringing a car or rental, especially for multiple nights.

We asked for early check in since we had a morning flight to get to Ireland, they wouldn't give us a time or ETA when I asked the front desk around 11am, so a bit unhelpful until I'd asked a third time.  but in the end they did let us check in an hour early.

i wasn't a fan of the hotel bar, but  I admit it just personal choice. felt it was more of a local bar, than a hotel bar. it was busy so obviously it was popular. .. but just lacked the hotel feel. which I like when I go to a four star hotel.

Thank you for taking the time to review our hotel. I am delighted that overall you enjoyed your stay and found the staff to be lovely. I am sorry that you didn't like the smell of the cleaning agents used in the hotel, it is not something that has been highlighted to us before, obviously with Covid there is additional cleaning being carried out on corridors so perhaps this is why it is stronger. Our bar is very busy with locals as it has an authentic pub feel, the lobby is a little quieter, I am sorry that the bar wasn't to your personal liking. I hope that overall you enjoyed your trip to Dublin and to the theatre. Thank you for your comments which are always of great assistance when improving our offering.

As you probably saw, our Chefs cook the items and bring them to the buffet, all of the food is cooked in small quantities and I can absolutely assure you that nothing is cooked and then served days later, we can cook eggs to order on request.

I am sorry that would not return to the hotel based on your experience with the Night Manager. I will certainly speak to the team to ensure that they are treating anyone entering the hotel with respect, however we do not allow anyone to approach customers asking for money so the person was asked to leave as would be our procedure.

I am sorry to see your review and that you were so unhappy with your stay. The room that you reserved is called a triple room on booking.com, however the description at time of booking and the photo is of one double and one single bedded room, we do not usually have an issue. 
It is unfortunate that you found the team that made up an extra bed for you to be unhelpful. 
We have addressed the paint that was peeling between the window in the bedroom, I am sorry that this was the case, heavy rainfall and an open window caused it to be that way and unfortunately as it was behind the curtain it was not noticed.

I asked the receptionist to call the manager. He was another new manager and was rude and ignorant. He finally agreed to discount the parking bit only this time. He said I was charged for parking because I used booking.com rather than book through the hotel directly. It was a punishment charge of sorts. Ridiculous. Never again will I stay there.

I am sorry to know that you will not stay with  us again. We do charge carparking at €10.00 per night. If a guest has a corporate rate with us, carparking is usually negotiated at the time of the negotiation. We also offer carparking as inclusive in rates booked via our own website due to savings that the hotel make on commission. Our information and confirmations all note that carparking is chargeable. I am sorry to hear that you felt the manager was rude or ignorant when confirming that your rate didn't include carparking but appreciate your feedback and it is certainly something that we will work on. 

Kind Regards

I think the parking should be included in the room rate - it’s €10 per day. Staff were quite slow at checking us in. Items in the vending machines were an extortionate price. The hotel bar was also disappointing as we paid €11.50 for a pornstar martini which was actually pre-made from a can and did not come with Prosecco. It did not taste great. Bartender said that it wouldn’t pay them to keep the ingredients for the drink in stock and that it was also an issue with training their staff.

Thank you for your feedback. I am delighted that you found the hotel to be in a good location for you and that you enjoyed Canal Express. Our vending machines are there for convenience so that guests have access to products on their floor without coming to Reception, we do not own the machines and so cannot dictate the prices, we also offer a full range of drinks and chocolate/ crisps at the Canal Express that you mentioned. Our carpark is charged at € 10.00 per night, this is quite reasonable in comparison to some of the hotel carparks in the city. Some of our rates do include the overnight parking, it depends on which one is chosen at the time of booking. I am sorry that you didn't enjoy the cocktail in the bar. We offer Craft Cocktails, 1661 which is a new and popular brand. We have had some great feedback on the taste and consistency of the cocktails since we started stocking them but I will ensure our Bar Manager is aware of your feedback. Thank you for letting us know your thoughts, it is always great to receive feedback like that so that we can improve our offering.

In an effort to sleep comfortably, I removed the quilt covers from the quilts and used only the quilt covers on the beds in an effort to stay cool.  We did open the windows, but the traffic was pretty noisy.   Some of the light bulbs were blown and the coffee machine worked only in one room.
I paid for the rooms on check-in, only to be advised on check-out that the hotel had undercharged initially and requested the balance to be paid, which I did.  
I don't feel the Reception staff welcomed the feedback.","6","7.5","7.5","7.5","5.0","5.0","7.5",""

I am sorry that you had a bad experience when you arrived at the hotel. As you describe, when you arrived at the hotel our system had just crashed resulting in a glitch. At no stage was your room given to another guest, but unfortunately it was not showing as available. After offering to accommodate you, and organise a taxi, he was able to manually figure out which room was available and empty. I am sorry that this took some time. I am glad that you found all of the other team members to be nice and hope that you enjoyed the complimentary breakfast that our Night Manager arranged for you. If you are travelling to Dublin again in the near future, please do not hesitate to contact us directly on salesoffice@grandcanalhotel.com and we can arrange a complimentary upgrade if at all possible.

As well as this, on our floor was the noisiest group of girls/women who came back in the early hours of every night (2am) singing and shouting, and continued to do so for hours (2am - 4am) every night. We relayed this to the reception staff at checkout and unfortunately they were a bit inhospitable and gave a half hearted 'sorry' response.

If you are traveling to experience Dublin we have stayed in much better places that were similar in price, much more updated, clean and better central location.

I appreciate your kind comment about our team and breakfast. Whilst I disagree with your description of a college dorm or retirement home, I am sorry that the hotel décor was not to your liking, it is disappointing to hear. Unfortunately, Dublin is experiencing a shortage of taxis at the moment and pre-booking from hotels is difficult, drivers prefer at busy times to pick up people on the street rather than travel to the hotel to pick up the fare. I am sorry that this impacted your stay but appreciate your feedback. Kind Regards, Donna Curry "

The rate reserved was on a room only basis which is why breakfast and carparking were not included.

We do have security on site during the matches to ensure our spaces are kept for guests only but as we were full both nights, arrivals are reliant on people departing so it can sometimes be a timing isssue.

I am sorry that you did not enjoy your stay. Unfortunately, we received no advance notice that you required a room adapted for less abled guests. We did not have one prepared. The room that you were offered at 2.30pm was next to renovation works that were due to stop at 4pm. When this was not acceptable there were limited options left to the team. As a gesture for your dissatisfaction an evening meal and breakfast were provided, I am sorry that you did not feel this was adequate. Our team will always go above and beyond to ensure guests are looked after but if we do not know in advance of specific requirements, it can be difficult.

The waitress, whose name I unfortunately did not remember, was very kind and helpful. Room service has a special story when you order from 10pm. The chicken sandwich was made as if the children were playing. If you do not have a night cook, it is better not to prepare food, it will be more useful for you, or to do additional training for the staff who prepare food at night. The taste is desperate. The room is very good, but the bathroom is in a very bad condition. Check in is a another story.

We are conveniently located to the city centre but it is a 15 minute walk. I am sorry that you didn't find our breakfast to be good value. We try to offer something to cater to all preferences on our hot buffet as well as a selection of cheese, salmon, cereals and bread. At €16.95 it also includes Tea/coffee/Toast and juice, so I am sorry to learn that you found it expensive. Thank you for your feedback, as always it is much appreciated.

Thank you for bringing this matter to our attention. We understand your concern regarding the conversion fee applied to your credit card payment during your stay.

Unfortunately, the conversion fee is typically applied by the issuing bank, and the hotel does not have control over the amount of money converted or any associated fees. 

We recommend that you get in touch with your bank again to reconfirm their policy on currency conversion fees. 

Our team is here to assist you in any way we can, and we appreciate your understanding in this matter. If you have any other questions or need assistance, please do not hesitate to reach out to us.

Die Betten waren bequem und schön waren auch die kleinen Körperpflegeprodukte von Rituals. Es war eine Kapselkaffeemaschine im Zimmer, Kaffeetassen, Milch, Zucker und eine Bügelsation. Die Fenster zu Straße sind doppelt verglast und dämmen sehr gut. WLAN war in unserem Zimmer etwas schwach, aber ausreichend. Gepäckraum ist vorhanden und mit Abholscheinen wird eine Verwechslung ausgeschlossen. Es kann vor Ort gefrühstückt werden und ein Restaurant ist auch direkt am Hotel (wir haben beides nicht genutzt). Zu Fuß benötigten wir ca. 30 min. bis zum Temple Bar Viertel. Die nächste Apotheke und ein Supermarkt ist in fünf Minuten zu Fuß erreichbar. Wir sind mit dem Dublin Express vom Flughafen bis Haltestelle Merrion Square Park gefahren (ca. 45 min.) und dann mit Gepäck bis zum Hotel nochmal ca. 10 min. zu Fuß. Es gibt in der Nähe eine Citybike-Verleihstation, so dass man mit dem Rad noch schneller in die Innenstadt gelangt (der Verkehr ist allerdings sehr rege, vor allem sehr viele Busse sind unterwegs).","Wir hatten ein Familienzimmer (drei Betten in einem Zimmer). Keine Klimaanlage und die Luft war mit drei Personen im Zimmer etwas knapp. Unser Fenster war Richtung Straße und wir haben die erste Nacht bei geschlossenem Fenster, die zweite wegen Sauerstoffmangel bei offenem Fenster geschlafen.

Thank you for your comments regarding the room. I am sorry that you had difficulty at the Front Desk. I have checked and the Receptionist was correct, the room was a 'NO PRE-PAYMENT REQUIRED' booking, this means that payment was due on arrival. Our Reservations Manager will contact Booking.com to investigate why you have been charged. If you have difficulty with contacting Booking.com, please do not hesitate to get in touch with us and we will see if we can assist. The hotel did not charge anything in advance of your stay and has only received the payment that you made on the front desk.

I am sorry that you had a negative experience at our hotel. From our records of your stay in November it is noted that two of our night staff went to the floor immediately-they found the gentleman in a different area on the corridor so may not have notified you of their arrival while they dealt with the person. The guest that was knocking on your room had made a mistake with the floor number which unfortunately is out of our control, instead of 513 he was knocking at your door on a lower floor. I am sorry that you felt that it took a long time for your call to be actioned.  We do have sufficient night staff on duty to action calls immediately, we also have double bolts on all doors as well as a key card operated system for the lifts which makes our hotel safer than most for guests. 

Kind Regards

Le testate sono state rivestite solo lo scorso anno ma probabilmente hanno scelto del materiale o un fornitore scadente.
Il prezzo della camera era un po’ alto ma nel periodo in cui sono stato sembra che gli hotel a Dublino fossero tutti abbastanza pieni e quindi i prezzi in base alla domanda salgono. ","8","10.0","7.5","7.5","7.5","7.5","5.0",""
